# MD5_Message_Digest_Algorithm
4th Year semester 2 project for the Theory of Algorithms module. This project is coded on a Google Cloud Virtual Machine (Linux Debian 10). The project is also coded using VI as an editor.

## Project statement
Write a program in the C programming language that calculates the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is speciﬁed in the Request for Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task Force. The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm — you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on. It is suggested you allow the user to input some free text or a ﬁlename via the command line.

## Research and Project Progress Summary
<b>Week 1:</b> In the first week I watched the video on how to set up my google cloud virtual machine and proceeded to do this myself. I also did some reading into MD5 message Digest Algorithm by reading a document describing the algorithm. [1]. I also watched some videos on the algorithm to further my understanding on the topic. [2]. I also did some basic coding in C and python from the video and as C is the chosen language for this project I looked back over the basics of C as well as projects I had previously coded in the language. I also played around with VI as I hadn't used this since 2nd year.

<b>Week 2:</b> In the second week I watched the video on SHA Standard. I then read over the document covered in the video a few days after watching it. [3]. I then read some sites talking about the differences between MD5 and SHA hash algorithms to improve my knowledge of the algorithms. [4] [5]. These sites compare them in many areas such as speed and security (i.e. SHA is more secure but slower, MD5 is faster but less secure). They also explain how each in them work in very simplistic terms which was very helpful for me to visualise the algorithms in comparison with the large documents read previously.
