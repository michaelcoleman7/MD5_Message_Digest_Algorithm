# MD5_Message_Digest_Algorithm
4th Year semester 2 project for the Theory of Algorithms module. This project is coded on a Google Cloud Virtual Machine (Linux Debian 10). The project is also coded using VI as an editor.

## Project statement
Write a program in the C programming language that calculates the MD5 hash digest of an input. The algorithm is speciﬁed in the Request for Comments 1321 document supplied by the Internet Engineering Task Force. The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm — you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on. It is suggested you allow the user to input some free text or a ﬁlename via the command line.
